function [sta, stabins]=stastat(filename, before, after, conditions)
%this function generates stimulus triggered averages for each condition,
%triggered to the onset of each stimulus condition,
%a common average reference is first applied
%file denoted by (filename) should have stimuli in vector StimulusCode in column vector
%file denoted by (filename) should have data in signal(pts,channels)
%before denotes time before stimulus to look at
%after (minus 1) denotes time after stimulus to look at
%conditions (array of length n) is n boolean statements on StimulusCode for stimuli to examine 
%conditions should have
